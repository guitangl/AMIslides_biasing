It is a beautiful, eloquent historical movie, though it is quite violent. It’s an anit-war movie in
+. It won five Oscar prizes in 1999: Best Cinematography, Best Director, Best Effects
Sound Effects, Best Film Editing, Best Sound. Tom Hanks was nominated for Best Actor, but
did not get it. It also won the Golden Globes for Best Director and Best Motion Picture. An it

Other candidate movies, and some arguments
Pulp Fiction (1994, crime / drama) > somewhat remote from our themes this year
The Silence of the Lambs (1991, thriller / horror) > also a bit remote
La Vita é Bella (1997) > not really an English movie, but a beautiful and successful
one, and fits perfectly into our general theme: should we propose an English version?
