It's the early nineties, sometime around the first Iraq war.
Jeffrey Lebowski, known as "The Dude” to his friends,
comes home and gets jumped and threatened by two guys.
They pee on his rug because they mistake him for another
Jeff Lebowski who is rich and whos wife owes money to
their boss. "The Dudes” two friends convince him to go to
the other Jeff Lebowski to get him to compensate him for
the rug. When the Lebowskis meet, their worlds collide
and get more and more mixed up with one another. While
"The Dudes” friends keep trying to help him, all they
succeed in doing is making his life more and more difficult
to get out of his situation.
