History

e Zenith engineer Eugene Polley invented the "Flashmatic,”
which represented the industry's first wireless TV remote.

e Introduced in 1955, Flashmatic operated by means of four
photo cells, one in each corner of the TV screen. The viewer
used a highly directional flashlight to activate the four
control functions, which turned the picture and sound on
and off. and changed channels by turning the tuner dial
clockwise and counter-clockwise.

e While it pioneered the concept of wireless TV remote
control, the Flashmatic had some limitations.
— It was a simple device that had no protection circuits and, if
the TV sat in an area in which the sun shone directly on it, the
tuner might start rotating.
